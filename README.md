# XamarinTools
A small collection of Classes/Interfaces for common I/O Tasks

This is very UWP-centric. Some features won't be available for Android/IOS.

IOS hasn't been tested (as I don't own a device by Apple/don't really care about Apples devices)
Android is a very cut down and adapted version of some of the functionally I originally developed for a UWP Project and subsequently used in nearly every Project I worked on.
